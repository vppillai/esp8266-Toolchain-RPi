Disclaimer: I am not a big fan of using the RPi as a development platform . But this was created on popular demand. :)

This toolchain runs on Raspberry Pi and generated binaries for ESP8266. It is created using a canadian-cross in crosstool-ng based on jcmvbkbc's crosstool-NG from github.

This is not yet tested and is under development. If someone can test it and update me , it will be a great help.
